| Class          | Effect                    |
| :------------- | :------------------------ |
| `.media`       | This class will span your `img`, `video`, etc. to 100% of the container.
| `.clearfix`    | The legendary clearfix. You know what it does. I can't believe people still use this.
| `.hide-visually` | This class hides the element completely from the naked eye, but leaves it available for screen readers and other assistive devices. Useful for labels and such.
| `.hide-overflow` | If you've got a block with its guts spilling out, this class will apply `overflow: hidden` and start a new block formatting context.
