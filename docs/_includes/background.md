## Background Images
---

The `.bg-img` helper class sets `background-size: 100%`, `background-repeat: no-repeat`, and `background-position: center`. The `cover` and `contain` modifiers tell it what it should do with the image while retaining its aspect ratio.

| Class             | Effect              |
| :---------------- | :------------------ |
| `.bg-img`         |  Centers background image, does not repeat         
| `.bg-img--cover`  |  Makes image cover the entire element        
| `.bg-img--contain`|  Constrains the image size to elements height or width
